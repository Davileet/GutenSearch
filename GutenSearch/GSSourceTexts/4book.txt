Introduction
Welcome
Welcome to Beginning Linux Programming, an easy?to?use guide to developing programs for the Linux and
other UNIX?style operating systems.
In this book, we aim to give you an introduction to a wide variety of topics important to you as a developer
using UNIX. The word Beginning in the title refers more to the content than to your skill level. We've
structured the book to help you learn more about what UNIX has to offer, however much experience you have
already. UNIX programming is a large field and we aim to cover enough about a wide range of topics to give
you a good 'beginning' in each subject.
Who's this Book For?
If you're a programmer who wishes to get up to speed with the facilities that UNIX (and Linux) offers
software developers, to maximize your programming time and your application's use of the UNIX system,
you've picked up the right book. Clear explanations and a tried and tested step?by?step approach will help
you progress rapidly and pick up all the key techniques.
We assume that you know the basics of getting around in UNIX and, ideally, you'll already have some C or
C++ programming experience in a non?UNIX environment, perhaps MS?DOS or Microsoft Windows.
Where direct comparisons exist, these are indicated in the text.
Important Watch out if you're new to UNIX. This isn't a book on installing or configuring Linux. If you
want to learn more about administering a UNIX system, UNIX concepts and UNIX commands in
general, you may want to take a look at Instant UNIX, by the same authors and Andrew Evans,
also published by Wrox Press (ISBN 1?874416?65?6).
As it aims to be both a tutorial guide to the various tools and sets of functions/libraries available to you on
most UNIX systems and also a handy reference to return to, this book is unique in its straightforward
approach, comprehensive coverage and extensive examples.
