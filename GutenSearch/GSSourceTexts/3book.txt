This book is one of them, a
compendium of those programmers notes and scribbles, deciphered (try reading programmer handwriting),
edited and brought together coherently as a book.
This updated second edition of the book has expanded, as Linux has expanded, and now covers writing
threaded programs (otherwise known as "how to shoot yourself in both feet at once") and the GTK toolkit
which is the basis of the GNOME GUI and probably the easiest way to write X windows applications in C.
Perl has crept into the book too. There are people who think Perl's time has come. There are those of us who
think Perl's time should have come and gone again a long time back. Regardless of my views, Perl has
become one of the most powerful (and at times arcane) scripting languages. All Linux programmers,
particularly anyone programming cgi scripts for the web, will meet Perl sooner or later so what better than a
Perl survival kit.
The final chapter is your chance to join the world of kernel programmers. As you will discover it isn't actually
that different to writing modules for large application programs. Put on your pointy hat, grow a beard, drink
Jolt Cola and come join in the fun.
