I am using the same UDP socket for sending and receiving data. I am wondering if packet queuing for DGRAM sockets is already present, or do we have to handle it separately.

If the user code has to handle queueing, how is it done? Do we have separate threads to recvfrom for the socket and put the packet in the reciver_queue and to sendto from another sending_queue?

An example code will be absolutely awesome. Thanks for your help.
